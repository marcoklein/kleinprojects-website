<p>Companies are complex structures with the larger ones having systems in place to steer and align through hierarchies, budget plans, and visionary directions in a multitude of business domains. Those structures create one big net of known and unknown dependencies, complexities, including company politics, or information silos.</p>
<p><em>Now imagine you are tasked to establish a new project within a company jungle, without yet grasping the full picture of dependencies and ongoing politics.</em></p>
<p>This article discusses an approach to structure the process of establishing a new project within an already existing and interweaved ecosystem of a large company.</p>
<h2 id="beginning-of-a-new-project" tabindex="-1">Beginning of a new project</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Who should you talk to? How can you be confident with decisions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the beginning of a new project. I am unsure who to talk to. I lack the overview of important people. I have no idea who has what opinion and what knowledge. There is no structured approach of communication, but it is rather a &quot;we talk to the people we talk to&quot;. We have no confidence in our communication strategy.</p>
<p>Where should I start?</p>
<p>How could we identify the right people that we should talk to? How can I align with the team on how we approach the right people? How can I be confidently concluding that our approach is leading into the best possible direction?</p>
<h2 id="collecting-people" tabindex="-1">Collecting people</h2>
<p>Usually, there is at least some idea behind the reasoning of a project kickoff. A project usually gets funding because of arguments in some group that are convinced by the initial idea. There is at least a bunch of people that are convinced enough to bother searching for people that support with creating that new thing.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I start collecting the persons that relate to the new project. An action that is quite obvious in hindsight but was nothing that I sought as valuable as it turns out to be.</p>
<p>I realize, that it is not only the people that relate to the new project but also other projects, other divisions, and even other legal entities. I collect all of them and map them into a big picture.</p>
<p>Creating this kind of overview helps a lot. Some might argue that it is a &quot;stakeholder map&quot;. But for a proper stakeholder map the collection and visualization is just an initial step. It helps to have tooling that allows different zoom levels like the C4 modelling approach.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-the-interweaved-net-of-people%2C-projects%2C-legal-entities" tabindex="-1">Understanding the interweaved net of people, projects, legal entities</h2>
<p>Related entities are mapped and visualized. Next step is the production of knowledge that allows the team to generate understanding in project dynamics and importance of stakeholders. It allows a common understanding of where we stand, how others see us, potential company politics, etc...</p>
<p>It is a basis for discussion who to reach out to next. Whom to address with what kind of information. Also to track which team possesses what kind of knowledge. Who is close to us? Who should be more close to us? Who is important?</p>
