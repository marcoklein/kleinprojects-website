<!-- A corporate company has tasked you with supporting the founding of a new project. It feels messy at first as you are not yet grasping the full picture of dependencies and ongoing politics. This article discusses approaches to bring structure and understanding into a company. -->
<!-- Catchy introduction that hooks readers. -->
<p>Problem statement:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new environment or changing project structures bring unforeseen complexity.</li>
<li>This article discusses how you can steer within such an environment by knowing people and projects that are involved</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="beginning-of-a-new-project" tabindex="-1">Beginning of a new project</h2>
<p>It is the beginning of a new project that I join. Tasked by a client of a corporate company to support with the creation of a new project in the role of a software architect. I lack the overview of important people, opinions and knowledge. There is no overview except for inaccurate org charts on the intranet.</p>
<p><em>Where should I start?</em></p>
<p>Initially, there is no technical system to design what I am rather used to do. But it's about the creation of a concept that we can present stakeholders and business owners to get further funding for our project.</p>
<p>I am used to software systems that follow certain well established patterns. Where something works or doesn't work because it is built on logical components.</p>
<!-- How could we identify the right people that we should talk to? How can I align with the team on how we approach the right people? How can I be confidently concluding that our approach is leading into the best possible direction? -->
<h2 id="a-company-is-a-system" tabindex="-1">A company is a system</h2>
<p>So, I take the approach of treating the company as a system. What would I do to design a new architecture?</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Collect what is there</em>: Create an overview of all available resources and options. In the case of understanding a company and project dynamics it is <strong>people</strong> and <strong>other projects</strong>.</li>
<li><em>Prioritize</em>: Which component is the most important one? Or in other words: which projects have the highest potentials? Who has the most influence or the greatest benefit?</li>
<li><em>Go and build</em>: Align with the team who to approach and when.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="collecting-what-is-there" tabindex="-1">Collecting what is there</h2>
<p>First, I collect all that is there:</p>
<ul>
<li>From my notes I collect all related <strong>people</strong> that I have met so far.</li>
<li>I yot down all related <strong>projects</strong> (teams, products, companies).</li>
<li>I gather relevant notes to understand <strong>connections</strong> between them.</li>
</ul>
<p>For <strong>people</strong> I collect all the names with titles that usually give an indication of importance. Sometimes, I try to be thorough - even the collection of team members is useful to understand team structures.</p>
<p>With <strong>projects</strong> I understand <em>groups of people</em>. For instance, this could be a team of people, a product, or even a company. More abstract speaking it is the <em>buckets</em> that I place people in to create some sort of systematic boundary.</p>
<p>Understanding <strong>connections</strong> is often the toughest exercise. Sometimes there is a clear distinction of who is supporting which team, however, there might also be individuals supporting multiple projects. Understanding how higher management is involved is also sometimes tough to grasp.</p>
<p>A small collection in text might look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Pen
<ul>
<li>Kim (Product Lead)</li>
<li>Carl (Software Architect)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Project Flower
<ul>
<li>Bob (Product Lead)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[Our Project]
<ul>
<li>Timmy</li>
<li>Myself</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="network-map" tabindex="-1">Network map</h2>
<p>The next step maps out all people, projects, and connections:</p>
<figure>
  <img style="max-width:600px; width:100%;" src="/images/2023-08-13-Navigating-Unknown-Project-Overview.svg"/>
</figure>
<p>It is a visual representation of the previous collection that allows a much easier understanding of project dynamics.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="potentials" tabindex="-1">Potentials</h2>
<ul>
<li>Alignment within team</li>
<li>Add information that are relevant for ure case</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="limitations" tabindex="-1">Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is a snapshot - you have to keep it up-to-date</li>
<li>It is only one dimension</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="collecting-people" tabindex="-1">Collecting people</h2>
<p>Usually, there is at least some idea behind the reasoning of a project kickoff. A project usually gets funding because of arguments in some group that are convinced by the initial idea. There is at least a bunch of people that are convinced enough to bother searching for people that support with creating that new thing.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I start collecting the persons that relate to the new project. An action that is quite obvious in hindsight but was nothing that I sought as valuable as it turns out to be.</p>
<p>I realize, that it is not only the people that relate to the new project but also other projects, other divisions, and even other legal entities. I collect all of them and map them into a big picture.</p>
<p>Creating this kind of overview helps a lot. Some might argue that it is a &quot;stakeholder map&quot;. But for a proper stakeholder map the collection and visualization is just an initial step. It helps to have tooling that allows different zoom levels like the C4 modelling approach.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-the-interweaved-net-of-people%2C-projects%2C-legal-entities" tabindex="-1">Understanding the interweaved net of people, projects, legal entities</h2>
<p>Related entities are mapped and visualized. Next step is the production of knowledge that allows the team to generate understanding in project dynamics and importance of stakeholders. It allows a common understanding of where we stand, how others see us, potential company politics, etc...</p>
<p>It is a basis for discussion who to reach out to next. Whom to address with what kind of information. Also to track which team possesses what kind of knowledge. Who is close to us? Who should be more close to us? Who is important?</p>
