<p>A daily note makes it simple to track thoughts, meetings, and events during a specific day.<br>
If you create a link for a <em>topic</em> that you mention in multiple dailies you will get time based relationships like the follow picture illustrates:<br>
</p><div><img style="max-width:300px !important; width:100%;" class="excalidraw-svg" src="/images/2022-04-09-How Daily Notes work in a networked note taking tool 2022-04-07 21.29.24.excalidraw.md.svg"></div><br>
<em>Note that in this case there is a daily note for each day and one topic note that would get referenced with a <code>[[Topic]]</code> link.</em><p></p>
<p>However, there will not be only one topic that you write down during a day but you will write notes regarding various topics like the following illustration depicts:<br>
</p><div><img style="max-width:300px !important; width:100%;" class="excalidraw-svg" src="/images/2022-04-09-How Daily Notes work in a networked note taking tool 2022-04-07 22.13.36.excalidraw.md.svg"></div><br>
This means: all three days mention Topic A, the 4th and the 5th link Topic B, and the 5th and 6th reference Topic C.<p></p>
<p>Let's see how this approach looks from different angles.<br>
If we select Topic B we would see this:<br>
</p><div><img style="max-width:200px !important; width:100%;" class="excalidraw-svg" src="/images/2022-04-09-How Daily Notes work in a networked note taking tool 2022-04-07 22.29.20.excalidraw.md.svg"></div><p></p>
<p>Selecting the 4th of April would show something like this:<br>
</p><div><img style="max-width:200px !important; width:100%;" class="excalidraw-svg" src="/images/2022-04-09-How Daily Notes work in a networked note taking tool 2022-04-07 22.31.50.excalidraw.md.svg"></div><p></p>
<p>In a conclusion, with a daily you can keep track of your information flow over time. Specific topics evolve over time which is inherently depicted by daily notes that reference and contribute to new topics.</p>
