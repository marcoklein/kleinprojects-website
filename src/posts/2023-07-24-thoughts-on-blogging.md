title: Thoughts on Blogging

So, I have been reflecting on blogging because it has been on my mind for quite some time to get more active with it. I have just been wondering why I blog and what I want to write about.

The following are just some thoughts that I am collecting about blogging:

## Personal vs. Professional

- Personal blog is hosted on own website. Not necessarily bound to my current company or career defining topics. I could share anything that I personally identify with:
  - Coding
  - Improvisational Theatre
  - Climbing
  - Music
  - Other random stuff
  -
- Professionally, I could write about things that are related to my current project or my current employer:

  - Topics I want do a knowledge sharing session about
  - Experiences regarding my roles in software projects
  - Coaching
  - Mentoring

- Personal articles may be:

  - Incomplete in respect to thoughts and written content
  - Covering random topics
  - Might be reflective loud thinking

- Professional articles may be:
  - Spellchecked
  - Proof read
  - Published and referenced in professional and social networks (e.g. LinkedIn, Medium, Reddit)

## Draft to Release

I might start writing something without finishing it. Shall I still publish?

- I should, because it might be motivating to publish stuff.
- I should, because it is hard to know when an article is truly finished for it's "release".
- I should not, because I would publish scattered information.
- I should not, because it might also indicated that the article is not of a high priority.

## Find a group or community to share thoughts with

- Could be at work or dedicated meetups.

- Good, because you can go into discussions and get feedback.
- Good, because you can validate ideas.
- Bad, because it is more time effort than just posting it (Really? A post might also take a long time.)

- In general, I see it as crucial step towards effective knowledge sharing.

## Find conferences to speak at

- Good, because you get a wide reach.
- Good, because talking and presenting is fun.
- Bad, because it might be hard to find a conference that is a good fit.
- Bad, because it needs the most effort.
