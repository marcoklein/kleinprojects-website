title: What this blog is about

There are tons of bloggers out there. Thousands, if not millions of posts. New content is published every second, every minute, every hour.

My goal with this blog is not the production of super popular posts or something.
My goal with this blog is to share thoughts and ideas I have about my current projects and about my current learnings.

> This blog is primarily for me, since I want to possess a blog; some kind of platform, where I can share my projects, my thoughts, my technical experiences, and my learnings.

Its for me to browse through the stuff that I did and see how my knowledge evolved.

### So why not offline?
Good question at first. I asked this myself without a straight answer popping up.

I think for me it is about getting better in writing. And since this content would technically be visible and available to all people among the internet I take this more seriously.

> On the long run, I am planning to publish more, improving gradually in summarizing ideas, learning new phrasings or wordings, getting better in describing technical concerns with focus.

So often as you here: start small - this is exactly what I am planning here.

### The fear of publishing bad content
When I completely rewrote this website I had this initial motivation of "blogging" more. Of producing more posts than before. However, I am sometimes writing something up - but then I won't publish it.

This is because I sometimes think: the content is not ready.. You need here an improvement an there.. This might seem as I haven't understood a thing ... and so on.

This is why I put some thought into the "why am I doing this" question.
