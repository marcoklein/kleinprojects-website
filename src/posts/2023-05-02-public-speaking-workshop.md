Was conducting a public speaking workshop session. One of the exercises was a 2 minute improvised talk about a certain topic. As participants also wanted me to present I took it and improvised a two minute speech about something.

Was interesting to get feedback: ticking all boxes for all categories that we have listed for "voice". BUT feedback was also that I did not came across authentic at all. "Felt like an advertisement". I also wanted to make it feel like an advertisement but was wondering: how can I control when I *act* versus when I try to be *authentic*? Can one reach *authenticity* when performing an act on stage?

Still an open thought.
