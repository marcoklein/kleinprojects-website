Currently, I am investigating approaches to work with linked notes - markdown notes in particular.
Linking notes is not a new concept but I found no application that meets my requirements to 100%. However, some applications start picking up these concepts like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) or [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/).

Inspirations:

- RoamResearch
- [[Obsidian]] <https://obsidian.md/>
- <https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5>
- [[Typora Note Taking App]] <https://typora.io/>
- [[Standard Notes]] <https://standardnotes.com/features>
- Markdown backlink janitor <https://github.com/andymatuschak/note-link-janitor>
