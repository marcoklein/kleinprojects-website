  <p>The following is a note to myself to reflect on options for making a current personal project <a href="https://impromat.app">Impromat</a> ready for search engines.</p>
<h2 id="background" tabindex="-1">Background</h2>
<p>Impromat is a single page application (SPA) and currently hosted on https://impromat.app. However, this comes with several issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's challenging to deal with search engine optimizations (SEO). As <a href="https://web.dev/rendering-on-the-web/">this article</a> from Google describes you can assume that crawlers cannot process JavaScript and thus cannot process SPAs.</li>
<li>In the future a login might be required. Then it's not possible to &quot;just share&quot; anymore, however, sharing workshops is still one core feature of the Impromat.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="possible-solutions" tabindex="-1">Possible Solutions</h2>
<h3 id="combine-seo-optimization-within-the-application" tabindex="-1">Combine SEO optimization within the application</h3>
<p>This means, that the backend would have to implement some kind of server side rendering (SSR) to allow the delivery of pre-rendered HTML that search engines could parse. There is <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/javascript/dynamic-rendering">another article</a> from Google that also mentions an,unfortunately discouraged, approach called <em>dynamic rendering</em>. With this approach the web server would send a different, SEO optimized result to web-crawlers.</p>
<p>Google also provides a very good discussion in <a href="https://web.dev/rendering-on-the-web/">this article</a> about the options and their advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<h3 id="separate-the-application-page-from-a-seo-optimized-landing-page" tabindex="-1">Separate the application page from a SEO optimized landing page</h3>
<p>Another approach would be the separation of the actual application that users access, and a separate landing page that can act as a representation within the world wide web. From SEO perspectives this would be an ideal case because a well optimized, dedicated web server could host the respective landing page and link to the Impromat application. However, this also adds another service and another application that needs maintenance.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Both approaches got advantages and disadvantages. I have to reflect on the goals in regards to SEO and future development of the Impromat.</p>
