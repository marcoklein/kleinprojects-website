<div class="content">
  <p>There are tons of bloggers out there. Thousands, if not millions of posts. New content is published every second, every minute, every hour.</p>
<p>My goal with this blog is not the production of super popular posts or something.
My goal with this blog is to share thoughts and ideas I have about my current projects and about my current learnings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This blog is primarily for me, since I want to possess a blog; some kind of platform, where I can share my projects, my thoughts, my technical experiences, and my learnings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its for me to browse through the stuff that I did and see how my knowledge evolved.</p>
<h3>So why not offline?</h3>
<p>Good question at first. I asked this myself without a straight answer popping up.</p>
<p>I think for me it is about getting better in writing. And since this content would technically be visible and available to all people among the internet I take this more seriously.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the long run, I am planning to publish more, improving gradually in summarizing ideas, learning new phrasings or wordings, getting better in describing technical concerns with focus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So often as you hear: start small - this is exactly what I am planning here.</p>
<h3>The fear of publishing bad content</h3>
<p>When I completely rewrote this website I had this initial motivation of &quot;blogging&quot; more. Of producing more posts than before. However, I am sometimes writing something up - but then I won't publish it.</p>
<p>This is because I sometimes think: the content is not ready.. You need here an improvement an there.. This might seem as I haven't understood a thing ... and so on.</p>
<p>This is why I put some thought into the &quot;why am I doing this&quot; question.</p>
<p><strong>Let's see how it goes :)</strong></p>
